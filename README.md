VirtualBox/VBoxManage Ansible Module in Python

Introduction
------------

This is an Ansible module for Virtual Box.

I couldn't find a suitable Anisible Module for driving VirtualBox 
and calling VirtualBox from Ansible via shell module was tedious.

At the moment it is a simple wrapper with some handling to make it easier to use.
